# DynamoDB GUI Client - Open Source Desktop Tool

DocKit is a **free, open-source DynamoDB GUI client** designed for developers who need a fast, secure alternative to the AWS Console and commercial tools like Dynobase.

## Why Use a DynamoDB GUI Client?

The AWS DynamoDB Console works, but it has significant limitations for developers:

- **Slow & Browser-Based**: Requires constant internet connectivity and multiple page loads
- **No Query Persistence**: Queries are lost when you close the browser tab
- **Limited Editing**: Complex workflows for simple data updates
- **No Multi-Account Support**: Switching between environments is cumbersome
- **Cloud-Only**: Must connect to AWS even for local DynamoDB instances

A dedicated **DynamoDB desktop client** solves these problems by running locally on your machine, offering faster performance, better data visualization, and persistent query history.

Watch how DocKit simplifies DynamoDB management with its intuitive UI and powerful PartiQL editor:
