# 🎉 DocKit v0.8 Released: Full DynamoDB Support

**January 20, 2026** - We're thrilled to announce the release of DocKit v0.8! This version brings complete support for **Amazon DynamoDB** to our open-source desktop GUI client, further expanding DocKit's capabilities as a unified NoSQL database management tool.

## 🚀 New Features Highlights

**DynamoDB Core Features**
- ✅ **Visual Query UI** - Scan and query tables without writing code, with support for primary key filtering and advanced conditions
- ✅ **PartiQL Query Editor** - Manage DynamoDB using SQL-like syntax with intelligent auto-completion
- ✅ **Inline Data Editing** - Update and delete items directly from query results
- ✅ **Simple Item Creation** - Create new items through UI forms, no JSON templates required
- ✅ **Script Persistence** - Automatically save PartiQL queries to local file system

**Unified Management Experience**
- 🔗 Connect to multiple DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, and OpenSearch instances in a single interface
- 💾 All connections and queries automatically persisted, never lose your work
- 🖥️ Cross-platform support: Mac, Windows, Linux

## Why Choose DocKit?

Compared to the AWS Console's web interface prone to misoperations, and existing desktop clients (like dynobase, dynomate) being closed-source and lacking active maintenance, DocKit offers:
- 🌟 **Fully Open Source** - Community-driven, continuous improvement
- ⚡ **More Efficient** - Desktop application, no containers or servers needed
- 🎯 **Multi-Database Support** - One tool to manage all your NoSQL databases
